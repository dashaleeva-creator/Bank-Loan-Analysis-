## 📌 Business Problem / Problem Statement

The bank receives thousands of loan applications across different states, income groups, employment backgrounds, and loan purposes. However, the bank lacks clear visibility into:

- Borrower repayment behavior  
- Loan profitability & losses  
- Seasonal trends in loan demand  
- High-risk vs. low-risk customer groups  
- Operational lending KPIs  

To solve these challenges, the bank requires an in-depth analysis of its loan portfolio across multiple KPIs, borrower segments, loan types, and repayment patterns.  
**The goal is to strengthen underwriting decisions, reduce charge-offs, improve profitability, and optimize lending strategy.**

## 🧩 Project Objectives

✔ Calculate all core lending KPIs  
✔ Compare Good Loans vs Bad Loans  
✔ Identify high-risk & profitable borrower segments  
✔ Analyze trends by month, state, term, employment length, purpose & home ownership  
✔ Provide business recommendations to reduce losses and increase ROI  

## 📊 Results Snapshot

- ✅ Portfolio Net Profit: **$37.31 Million**
- 📉 Total Loss from Bad Loans: **$28.25 Million**
- 💼 Good Loan Success Rate: **86.18%**
- 🏆 Top Low-Risk Groups: **Mortgage holders & 10+ year employees**
- ⚠️ High-Risk Groups: **Renters & <1 year employment**
- 🌍 Highest-performing state: **California (CA)**
